      <h2>Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
      <p>This was a Tic-Tac-Toe style game without user input. 
        Player moves were called by functions and after each turn
        it would be detected if there was a win or draw and the game
        would end if so. Outputs were fully within the terminal and were made
        with JavaScript.

      <h2>Patient Profile</h2>
      <p>This program shows the patient profile part of a patient health record management system. 
        It was made using JavaScript and runs through a command line interface (CLI) which lets users 
        such as patients and health providers input or view patient information as well as update patient information.
        The data is then updated in a seperate JSON file.
